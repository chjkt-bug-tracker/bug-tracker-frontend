### **Conflict Plan**

- **What will be your group's process to resolve conflict when it arises?**

Talk it out. Listen to the source of the conflict and compromise or reason if necessary.

- **What will your team do if one person takes over the project without letting the other members contribute?**

Communicate to the individual and understand why they're doing what they're doing, and if we can agree, we will work towards a said agreement.

- **How will you approach each other and the project's challenges knowing that all members can't be at the same level of understanding and skill?**

Each day will be split into three components, the daily initial steps of progress (before lunch, the daily progress check-up (after lunch), and the daily progress wrap-up (before the end of the day. During the progress wrap-up, the wrap-up is where we can communicate what is happening in the project, so each of us understands everyone's work.

- **How will you raise concerns to members who need to be adequately contributing?**

Bring it up at one of the daily stand-ups and discuss together as a team what the reason is. Then, negotiate a plan to overcome the issue. If the negotiation fails, bring the issue up to the instructor for further resolution.

- **How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

It will be helpful to consult a voice of reason, whether it's a TA, instructor, or even another peer that can see our situation from a different perspective.
